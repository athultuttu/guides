## Colors

CSS Colors is a CSS module that deals with colors, color types, color blending, and opacity. Not all CSS properties that take a <color> as a value are part of this module, but they do depend upon it.
Colors are specified using predefined color names, or RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, HSLA values.

HTML supports 140 standard [color names](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp).
